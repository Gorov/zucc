bratislavan and transylvanian type vampires . for killing , only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect . of course one is not likely to find these implements ( garlic , crosses , or silver weapons ) in the vampire 's own abode . this creates a problem for bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals . they achieve this without the use of silver ( which might be turned against them ) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible . yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent . the dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will , and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available .", "action": "read killing"}}
