that someone gutted this entire floor . you are looking out on one , huge room . no other rooms , no walls of any kind apart from the ones enclosing this gigantic area just nothing but empty room as far as you can see . in the center of the floor a circle perhaps 30 feet in diameter is outlined in the floor with ash . the inside of the circle is ringed with many odd symbols you ca n't begin to identify . the acrid smell of something burning assaults your nostrils . a box made of solid platinum is sitting on the floor here . on top is a small emerald .       the platinum box and the small emerald crowning it glows a very bright green accompanied by what sounds like a chorus of singing angels !    a man is materializing in the room , at first projected by a ray of green power emanating from the small emerald but in mere seconds the ray is gone and the man is here ... he is garbed in the tabbard of bostwin and he sports a cape which is only reserved for high officers and nobility ! looking around the room he suddenly looks distressed and exclaims \" my castle . what the hell happened to my castle ? ! well nevermind that , i 'm here and that means it 's payback time to a certain bastard who should still be wandering around my castle . \" and with that he holds out his once empty hand which is instantly occupied by a familiar jewel encrusted dagger . \" after that , i may actually resume my official duties as duke . but let me not forget you ... \" pausing to look at the rank on your uniform , \" captain . should my peers of this age find it agreeable i will resume my noble office as befits my rank and appoint you the captain of my personal guard ! my many thanks to you for freeing me from the hell of that limbo prison i was contained in . now if you 'll excuse me ... \"    lord galin dashes out of the room wearing a big grin on his face , which is shortly followed by the shocked bellow of outrage of a certain dark elf and then the loud thud of what must be a dead body . in the distance you hear galin 's voice laughing merrily ...             you have won        in that game you scored 60 out of a possible 70 , in 34 turns . would you like to restart , restore a saved game , undo your last move or quit | you are carrying :    a jewel encrusted dagger    a towel ( which is open but empty )    a fine pentarian sword | you put the small emerald on the top of the box .", "action": "put emerald on box"}}
